This requires windows, and we brought steamspy **membership** to get access to download data, so you may **not** be about to reproduce the download process.

**However in order to get data that dose not include in the html, there must be some workaround, please acknowledge the effort we put into scraping data, it took three of us a full week to get this download.7z data **

We used AutoHotkey_2.0-beta.13_setup.exe, it can take screenshot of your web browser and do some auto click script to download data accordingly, there are some anti-cheat, but we managed to have an workaround.

In **asset** folder is the screenshots used to do image finding.

**download.ahk** is the script by autohotkey to download data.

All download data have been compress to **download.7z**, which contains 2188 csv files.
